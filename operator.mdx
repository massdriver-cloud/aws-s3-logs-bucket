# aws-s3-logs-bucket
An AWS S3 bucket providing scalable, durable, and secure storage of logs allowing them to be stored, accessed, and analyzed in a highly available and cost-effective manner.

## Use Cases
### Application Logging
Low cost and durable storage of application logs for debugging and troubleshooting
### Security and Compliance
Storing access logs allows security teams to monitor and detect unauthorized access attempts and security breaches, and helps to satisfy compliance requirements for data access audit trails.

## Design
This bundle is designed around the specific use-case of storing application and access logs. For this reason, assumptions are made regarding the configuration of the bucket. For example, public access is disabled and object versioning is disabled.

## Best Practices
### High Availability
Deploys regional S3 for High availability in the event of zonal failure
### Dedicated KMS Key
Uses a dedicated KMS key with narrowly scoped permission for encryption

## Security
### KMS Encryption
A KMS key is created and narrowly scoped to the bucket for encrypting all assets.
### Private ACL
No public access is allowed to this bucket
### Access Logging
Access logging can be enabled, which will create an additional S3 bucket to store access logs for compliance requirements

## Policies
The following policies are created for managing access to the S3 bucket.
* `read`: Grants read access to objects in the bucket
* `write`: Grants access to write objects to the bucket
